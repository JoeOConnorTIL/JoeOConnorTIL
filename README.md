# 👋 Hi, I'm Joe

I've transitioned from a career in policing to the world of data — and I haven't looked back.

I now work at **The Information Lab**, where I specialise in tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and **Alteryx**, helping organisations turn their data into insights that drive decisions.

## 📚 Currently Learning

I'm expanding my technical skills into:

- **SQL** – building databases, writing queries, and designing star schemas  
- **Python** – using libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis  

You’ll find projects on my GitHub that reflect this learning journey — from SQL challenges to small Python experiments.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Data Visualisation**: Tableau | Power BI  
- **Data Prep & Automation**: Alteryx | Tableau Prep
- **Languages**: SQL | Python  
- **Other**: Regex
